# AI & Finance Projects

This repository contains my various projects related to AI & Finance, aimed at optimizing investments and analyzing different financial markets.

### Scrappers

- **stock_scrapper.py** : Script to scrape financial data from various sources including Yahoo Finance. (Current prices and historical data) 

- **crypto_scrapper.py** : Script to scrape crypto data with the Binance API. (Current prices and historical data)

- **data_extraction.ipynb** : Notebook to keep track of the different databases I extract and show what we can do with the scrappers
  - Examples :
    - Extract current prices of all s&p500 companies
    - Extract current prices of all CAC40 companies
    - Extract the whole historical data of NVIDIA + curves plot
    - Historical data of the whole CAC40 companies with 1 day interval since 2020

### ML Predictions
- Baseline [TODO]


### LLM For sentiment analysis and news tracking

- Media tracking & Scrapping [TODO]
- Social networks tracking & Scrapping [TODO]



### Combine ML predictions and news/sentiment tracking



### Notebooks


# TODO next :

- Test ML prediction on different stock/crypto with a very large dataset scrapped (test combine both)
- LLM automation to read news on finance / crypto
- Combine both projects to see if we can have better preds with Curves and wold news
